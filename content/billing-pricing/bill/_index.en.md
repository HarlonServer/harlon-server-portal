Each year Harlon costs around $550 dollars to operate. Whilst Harlon is and will forever be a free server to play on, a donation page exists if you wish to make a financial contribution to help cover the operating expenses of the server.

The donations made help us cover these yearly costs:

- $432 USD/year for server hosting - currently an AMD Ryzen 5950X CPU & 10GB RAM.
- $97 USD/year for website hosting - this covers in addition to the website itself the play.harlonserver.net & dynmap.harlonserver.net domains for example. This price is exchanged to USD from SEK (808 kr.) as of the exchange rate on 2021-02-25.
- Circa $25 USD/year for plugin expenses - Based on the cost of plugins purchased for Harlon in 2020.
- In total, this is $554 USD per year.

We really appreciate any and all donations, as they help us keep Harlon running. Additionally, there is also a [Donator] rank which can be unlocked once you have donated.
