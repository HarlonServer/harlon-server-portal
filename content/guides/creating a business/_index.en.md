### How to start your business on Harlon City Server
> "Hey, it's very simple! Just follow these easy steps!"
- Head over to the Underground and go to an industrial area. Let's go to Penrith, for example.
- Once in an industrial area, find an available factory. 
- When you found one you like, simply click the sign to purchase and it's all yours!
- Take the tools you get in your starting kit in the chests, and GET GOING!
- Take care of your animals and make sure all your vegetables are fine!
- Then, head back into the city and find a store space you like! If you need help finding one, just contact staff. You buy the store the same way you did with the factory.
- Then, head on over to a furniture shop to get the tools you need to decorate your store! There are several near spawn, such as City Furniture or Daily Needs.
- Then, stock up your chests with the item you wish to sell. Only one type of item per chest.
- Then, follow this example on how to create a ChestShop (*see 3:46 in the video for the example*):
	Leave the top line blank, it will become your username when placed.
	Amount (Replace 1 to the amount you want)
	Item name (Replace Bread to the name of the item you put in the chest)
	Price (Replace 1 to the price you want)
